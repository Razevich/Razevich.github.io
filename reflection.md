1) I learned a bunch about padding, borders, margin and the likes with this challange. I learned that they are a pain in the ass sometimes to get everything the way you want it. Css is a bigger pain than I thought it would be, I am going to need a lot more practice.

2) Positioning is a HUGE pain in my ass, this is going to take me a ton of work to get ready and feel secure in this.

3) Background color... super easy. Everything else was a pain.

4) I learned that holy crap do I have work to do. Trying to make my site look like it came out after 1995 is a pain.
