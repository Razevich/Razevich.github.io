    <h1>You want to remember all of that?</h1>
      <h3>September-13-2015</h3>
        <p>Let's say that I give you a ton of information about my favorite hockey team and all the years they made the finals. 1992, 2012, 2014. (2016 hopefully!) and I wanted you to remember all of that. That might be easy for some, it is just three numbers. But what if my team was a lot better in the past? What if they had made it 20 times? That gets to be a lot of information and we want a way to store all of that. We need an Array or a Hash.
        </p>
        <p>Let's look at arrays. An array is a way to store objects in an ordered way. lets say we wanted to store those kings finals. We could store it in an Array called Kings
          Kings = [1992, 2012, 2014]
        Then if we ever needed to know what year the kings made it, we could iterate over the array(Or have the array tell us what it holds) by going
         kings.each do |playoffs|
          puts #{playoffs}
        end
        This would return us with 1992, 2012, 2014.
        Now let's say that we wanted to know just the second time they made the finals. We could go puts kings{1}
        and we would get 2012. Now I know you are asking... we wanted the second one! why do we now have the first? That is because arrays start at 0 and go from there. Think of it like 1->0 2->1 3->2 and so on, shift everything down a number.
        </p>
        <p>Now what if we wanted to know all the times the kings made the playoffs, all the times they made it to the finals, and all the times they won. That would be a lot of information that we could store, but the array would not be the best to tell us all of this information. For this we would love to use a Hash. A hash differs from an array in that we use key words that we assign a value to, when we call those key words we actually get the Value
        </p>
        <p> So lets go back to the Kings, and lets say we wanted to know all of the times they have done anything in the playoffs. We could make a hash very much like we made an array.
          Kings = {
           :playoffs => "1986, 1987, 1992, 2012, 2014"
           :finals => "1992, 2012, 2014",
           :champs => "2012, 2014"
        }
        (There are actually more years they made the playoffs, I can just not find the stats.)
        Now we can call this information by going
        puts #{Kings[playoffs]}
        of just #{Kings[0]}
        Because Hashs also order things by the 0 number.
        Hashs are also great for security. They allow you to assign information to different keys that can be randomly generated. You can then check if the information someone trys to access matches the key.
