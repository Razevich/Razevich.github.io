      <h1>Css and pain></h1>
      <h3>September-6th-2015</h3>
        <p>Holy crap CSS! You have been the biggest pain in my ass the last week. While I am a huge fan of you, and I love what you do. I hate working with you. I hope that changes in the future, but for now I give you a One Star review on Yelp.</p>
        <p>It is not all bad though! Some things I really enjoy, and are insanely easy! One of those things is the use of Class and ID. Both of these are used to change an element in HTML and add css to it. Let us say you have two paragraphs. One of these you want to be the normal font that shows up, but the other you want to Jazz up. You want to make that thing red, you want to put a crazy font on it, you want to go ham! So what would you do ? You would add a class to the paragraph tag that you wanted to change. Fix that class with some CSS, and BOOM! Crazy fun times to be had! </p>
        <p>Now I say you would use a class, and you go "But Colin! what about ID?" Well hod on there friend! You do want to use a class there because what if you write another paragraph and you decide you want it to look like your crazy fun time one! That is the beauty of the class, it lets you use it as many times as you want! Five Hundred Thousand paragraphs? NO PROBLEM! class is for you! Now we need to talk about why it is different from an ID. That is because IDs are only to be used one.</p>
        <p>Now comes the power! The ID! Why is it so powerfull? Because it is unique. When creating a page and styling with CSS, you must only use each ID once! Because they have special things tied to them. If you are searching on a webpage, lets say www.woo.com#comments. Your webpage will look for the comments ID in your css, find where that is attatched to in your HTML, and go there. That is why you must never have more than one. It is also important for when you pull up Javascript. Javascript will want to act on the ID's that you have used so that it knows where to attatch itself to and run its functions. This is why ID's must only be used once, while classes can be used as many times as they want. because a class will not be used for Java script and will not be used by your URL.
