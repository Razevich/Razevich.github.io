        <p> This is the first entry in my blog. This blog will track the progress I make as a developer and probably as a person. (hopefully they both improve.) To start I want to talk about what I am learning, mainly Git and GitHub. There are many things that are new and exciting for me with these two things. (And holy crap so many headaches). I want to address a few things to start. Mainly what is version control and why you should use it, how git is so useful, and just why the hell am I using GitHub.</p>
        <p> Let's start off with version control. Version control is important for so many reasons, but probably the most important is the ability for multiple people to work and the same project without stepping on each others toes. With a VCS (version control system) You are able to have multiple people work on the same projects, in different sections, without messing up the master file. What it does is create different versions on each persons computer. This allows each individual to make changes to the section they are working on independently of others work. When you feel that your section is done, has no bugs, works like a charm. You can then push it into the master file and make the changes onto the final project. Another great tool is the ability to go back in time. With version control you are (at least should be) creating many different versions of your work. Each time you make a change, the old version is still kept, and is able to be re visited. This means that if you break something in your code, you are able to go back to before it was broke and it will give you a better idea of what went wrong. I could keep listing the benefits but I need to keep this first entry short, so I will leave it here and re visit as I learn more and can better state my thoughts.</p>
        <p> Next we move onto Git and why it is useful. Git is useful for its ability to keep track of changes. When working in git you are able to make new changes to what you are working on at any time. lets say that you are writing a blog (Look at how clever I am with this) and you decide that you hate the last few things you did. You are actually able to go back to before you made these changes and access that information again. Or, lets say something goes wrong with one of your changes. You can go back and see what was working before the break, what was changed, and then you can make step by step fixes to figure out what the problem was and how to work around it. That last thing works very well for people like me, who suck at code but want to get better.</p>
        <p>The last part is just why the hell am I using GitHub. I use it because of how simple and well designed it is. It works so well with Git(which I just talked about how great Git is) and is very easy to use. It stores my information online, allows me to look at all the changes I have made with a GUI, and allows me to see what comments I have left to myself on those changes. It is also great because of the wealth of knowledge it contains. I am able to look at how more experienced programmers solve problems. Github documents their step by step process and allows me to learn from them.</p>
        <p> This was the first of many blog entries to come, I know the writing is crap, but hopefully it gets better! See you latter </p>
