    <h1>So what is the Internet?</h1>
      <h3>October-9th-2015</h3>
        <p>The Internet is a series of tubes! No! It is just a giant cloud. Or maybe it is actually a wizard named Interneticus who secretly rules the world from the shadows? Do not be silly, it probably is not a wizard. No, the best way to think of the internet is actually a straight line. We use this line to connect to other computers and to websites. This one line has changed the world. Now we must ask the most important question for this instalment of this blog. How the F*** does it work?
        </p>
        <p>The Internet works by connecting one computer to another. This sounds simple and easy, guess we are done here. Wait... no, there is a lot more. Everything that can connect to the internet has a unique IP addres(Or internet protical address). Your computer, your phone, your tablet, that one really powerfull potatoe. They all have a unique IP adress. Now not all things are the same. The items you use to connect to the internet are called clients. What you connect to are called Servers. and then there are nodes that direct traffic. This is all done by a set of proticals that all mechines use. If it were not for a standard set of proticals, nothing would work.
          <pre>
            It works kind of like this.

               Google   Friends comptuer

                ----------------
                |
          Your computer

            You start at your computer and head to the server, which in this case is google.
            From the google server the information goes across the internet over to your friends computer.
            You two have comunicated accross the internet. Neat huh?
          </pre>
        </p>Now when you send information over the internet, it is often broken into smaller chunks. Imagine you had to move a bed across town, do you lift it up as one and move it? or do you break it apart and work piece by piece, putting it back together when you get to where you need to be? If it is the first thing, I think you are crazy. But if you are sane, and do it like most people, congrats! You now understand how the internet does things. When a file is sent it is broken down into small chunks called packets. Those packets are then sent online and re essembled at the destination. This is just one small element to how the internet works, but I hope you learned something!
