      <h1>What will it be like?</h1>
      <h3>August-22-2015</h3>
    <p>
      So, this is it. I, and many others are making the jump. We are all doing this DBC thing in order to change our lives in a way we hope is for the better. I know I had an idea of what DBC would be, and now that I have been in a week some of those ideas have changed. I want to write about what I thought going in, and what I think now.
    </p>
    <p>
        So going in is a good place to start right? I remember when I was told about DBC, about the benefits of graduating from this bootcamp, about how hard it was. I had talked to a former student and knew it would be work. I thought Prep, or phase 0 would not be that hard. I have previous experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the likes. I figured I would blow through Phase-0 and work on things to prep me for Phase-1 the whole time. When I would arrive for phase -1 I knew the world load would be hard. I expected to spend maybe 40 to 50 hours a week of work. These are just the basics of what I thought things would be like.
    </p>
    <p>
        What I think now is totally different. I had no idea how to use Git and it kind of kicked my ass in week one. While I feel better about it now, it showed me that I will have to work hard in Phase-0 to get the most out of it, it will not be a cake walk. Phase-1(and the rest) has also been ramped up in my mind. After hearing the instructors talk I figured out that 50 hours a week is not nearly enough time to get through everything I will need. While spending 70 + hours a week at school for 9 weeks does not sound 100% fun, I am excited for what I will be learning and how it will effect my life.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mindset that they drill into you at DBC is also different than I thought it would be. I assumed that it would be more about how intelligent I am to start, how much information I can absorb. It is not that way at all. They really push the idea that you can learn as much as you need if you just push yourself. That if you go in thinking that you do not know everything, and that that is a good thing. They want you to come in hungry to learn. The mindset is not, oh I got this perfect, it is more that this isn't perfect and how can I make it so.
    </p>
    <p> That is the end for now, I will probably update this as my time in DBC goes on. Bye for now.
