<!-- It was actually great to wireframe with a pair, I did not have to do a ton!

  - Not really, I find wireframing pretty unhelpful. I have a plan for a website in my head, and design choices that I would make when I see a more finished product.

  - What we came up with, why would we keep it if we did not think it was good?

  - I learned about nav, which is a great wat to store links. Will be using this a lot -->
