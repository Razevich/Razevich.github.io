      <h1> Where the work gets done.</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my website! If you can not already guess, the handsome man up in the corner is me! Colin Razevich.
        </p>
        <p>Now you might be asking just who is Colin Razevich? Is he a billionaire playboy who saves the world from nuclear terrorist at night? Or a billionaire playboy who saves the world from chemical warfare during the day? Well this is the place to find out!
        </p>
        <p>I was born in a small town in the middle of Europe under a full moon and surrounded by the animals of the forest. This town was called Torrane C.A United States. From this humble start in 1988 I have traveled far and wide. From Torrance C.A, to Gardena C.A and Manhattan beach C.A and even to Northridge C.A!! These far flung cites that are only about 5 miles apart from each other are just some of the places I spent time as a child.
        </p>
        <p>I grew up with a love of Hockey and music. I started the former at the age of 5, traveling to different states to play in tournaments (Nationals twice, never won, sad days) and even to a tournament in Canada (Got crushed, who knew Canadians were really good at hockey?) and the latter I started when I was 16. I have been playing classical guitar for about 11 years now and I am still pretty horrible at it. but my mother says I sound good and that is all that matters right? I am also a huge DOTA2 fan, I watch it more than I should and play it WAY more than I should. It is turning into a problem, I probably need help.
        </p>
        <p>I am supposed to end this in fine DBC tradition with something quirky, and I might as well make that about dota. As I write this I have 2600 hours on the game. I said it was a problem.
